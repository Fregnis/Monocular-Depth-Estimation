# Monocular Depth Estimation: a Transfer Learning approach
Machine Learning for vision and multimedia course project @ PoliTO

# ABSTRACT
Accurate depth estimation is crucial in various computer vision tasks related to scene understanding and image reconstruction. Depth estimation models have lately shown to be powerful tools when implemented in sensor fusion frameworks applied to contexts involving mapping of unknown environments, in applications related to mobile robotics (SLAM) or autonomous vehicles.
While the most common approaches involve processing of stereo images pairs, this project aims at developing a Convolutional Neural Network to produce estimated depth maps of scenes represented by single monocular images. The model exploits a simple encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections, where the encoder block is extracted from the backbone of a YOLOv8 pre-trained for instance segmentation tasks. This Transfer Learning approach exploits the powerful feature extraction capabilities of one of the best state-of-the-art models, allowing to obtain a small and simple architecture able to produce accurate results even if trained for short times and on a relatively small dataset such as NYUv2.
